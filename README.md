### Project Description:
The objective of Lyricsmus is to recreate the Phonosphere website, a showcase for a music group, using Vue.js. The team will work collaboratively to implement the front-end design and functionality, ensuring a seamless user experience similar to the original WordPress site. The project will involve translating the existing website's design into Vue.js components, incorporating dynamic content and interactivity where necessary.

The repository will contain Vue.js components, CSS stylesheets, and any other necessary files for the project's development. The team will follow an agile approach, breaking down tasks into manageable chunks, and ensuring regular communication and collaboration throughout the development process.
